# Project Description

Collection of installation scripts, configuration scripts and other
things new users may find useful when setting up new tools.

Eventually, this will include Emacs integration, Git,
etc. Installation instructions and platform-specific gotchas are
appreciated.

# R

- packages.R:

    Downloads and installs a curated list of popular R
    packages. Includes the packages recommended by the R Core Team
    (R-Recommended) andother popular packages.

    This collection is a (slowly) moving target. For example, knitr
    has been replaced by the rmarkdown package which has superseded
    it. This list will not focus on backwards compatibility. Rather,
    it will focus on the packages that are currently being used in the
    R community.
