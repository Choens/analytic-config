# Project Description

Collection of installation scripts, configuration scripts and other
things new users may find useful when setting up new tools.

Eventually, this will include Emacs integration, Git,
etc. Installation instructions and platform-specific gotchas are
appreciated.

# R

- packages.R:

    Downlaods, installs and tests a selection of popular
    packages. Includes the packages recommended by R-Core and popular
    packages such as those from Hadley Wickham, etc.

    This collection is a (slowly) moving target. For example, knitr
    has been replaced by the rmarkdown package which has superseded
    it.
